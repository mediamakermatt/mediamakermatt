# About MediaMakerMatt

This is a personal repository that holds my sandbox development, personal projects, works in progress, and overall public portfolio.

## Public Portfolio

The portfolio is built using WordPress for ease of access to public plugins, to build personal plugins, and to demonstrate the ability to use a CMS.

## Sandbox Development

Any work that is constantly a work in progress or not yet finished which will go into the public portfolio will be contained in the sandbox folder - in the 'mediamakermatt' theme in WordPress.

## Personal Projects

Any personal projects not pertaining to the public portfolio or part of a WIP / Sandbox element that will go into the public portfolio will be contained in the "personal-projects" folder - in the "mediamakermatt" theme in WordPress."
